These projects can also be found at my Tableau public profile - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.moore4696/vizzes

## Audible Project

### Aim of Project
Visualize the Audible data to highlight the spread of language, price and number of releases since 1999.
To discover 
* Spread of audio books across each language
* The number of audio books released each year
* Highest rated authors
* Average price of audio books dependent on language
* If more expensive books are more highly rated

### Context
Audible has been around since 1995 however in 1997 they started to release audio books. In 1999 Microsoft invested 11 million USD into the company and since then Amazon bought Audible in 2008. Since then, Audible has grown in popularity and use so this project was made to gain an overview of Audibles data and to demonstrate my ability to use Tableau.

### CSV changes
Before I uploaded this csv to Tableau, I added a new column (GBP price). The reason for this is that the price of these audio books was in Indian Rupees as this data set was formed in India and I wanted to visualise the price of these books in Great British Pounds. To do this I used the current exchange rate of 1 INR to 0.009140 GBP and multiplied the value in the price column with the exchange rate resulting in the price being in GBP.
