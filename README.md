# Audible

## Aim of project
Visualize the Audible data to highlight the spread of language, price and number of releases since 1999.

## Context
Audible has been around since 1995 however in 1997 they started to release audio books. In 1999 Microsoft invested 11 million USD into the company and since then Amazon bought Audible in 2008. Since then, Audible has grown in popularity and use so this project was made to gain an overview of Audibles data and to demonstrate my ability to use Tableau.
